# Learning Operating Systems (OS)

## Overview
This repository documents my **personal learning journey in Operating Systems (OS)**.  
It captures the concepts, exercises, and experiments I completed while studying OS fundamentals and practicing system-level programming.

---

## Learning Objectives

Through this repository, I aimed to:

- Understand the core concepts of operating systems  
- Gain practical experience with system-level programming  
- Explore how computers manage resources such as CPU, memory, and storage  
- Learn process management, scheduling, and concurrency  
- Explore memory management, paging, and virtual memory  
- Understand file systems and I/O management  
- Practice synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, semaphores, condition variables)

---

## Topics Covered

- **Processes and Threads:** creation, termination, context switching  
- **CPU Scheduling:** algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority  
- **Memory Management:** paging, segmentation, virtual memory  
- **File Systems:** file operations, directories, and storage allocation  
- **Concurrency:** critical sections, race conditions, deadlocks  
- **Synchronization:** mutexes, semaphores, monitors  
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** pipes, shared memory, message queues  
- **System Calls:** understanding OS interfaces and program interactions

---

## Learning Approach

- Started with **theory and lectures** to understand OS concepts  
- Implemented **small exercises in C/C++** for hands-on practice  
- Wrote programs to experiment with processes, threads, and synchronization  
- Debugged and analyzed behavior using tools like `gdb`, `valgrind`, and system monitors  
- Took notes and created diagrams to visualize OS mechanisms

## Skills Developed

- Ability to reason about **processes, threads, and concurrency**  
- Understanding of **how operating systems manage resources**  
- Hands-on experience with **C/C++ system programming**  
- Debugging and problem-solving skills in low-level programming  
- Familiarity with **Linux commands and system tools** for OS experimentation
